## Summary

South Africa’s biodiversity is subject to a complex interplay of natural and anthropogenic pressures.

Among the various pressures on biodiversity, croplands account for the most extensive impact, covering large areas across the country. Built-up areas represent the second most widespread pressure, followed by plantations, which continue to exert considerable influence on natural ecosystems.At the national scale, both cropland and secondary-natural areas increased substantially between 1990 and 2014. During the same period, built-up areas, plantations, mine, and artificial waterbodies also expanded, though to a lesser extent. Between 2014 and 2018, most land cover classes continued to increase, with notable gains in built-up, plantation, and secondary-natural extents, while cropland and artificial waterbodies declined. From 2018 to 2022, a slight decline was observed in mine and secondary-natural areas. Built-up extent remained largely unchanged, whereas plantations, cropland, and artificial waterbodies showed slight increases.

## Provincial summaries

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
### Eastern Cape

The Eastern Cape consists of eight district municipalities: Amathole, Alfred Nzo, Buffalo City, Chris Hani, Joe Gqabi, Nelson Mandela Bay, O.R. Tambo, and Sarah Baartman. The province is dominated by vegetation that transitions between biomes. Subtropical thicket transitions into savanna in the east, fynbos in the west, and Nama Karoo and grassy ecosystems in the north. Therefore, the Eastern Cape has the potential to support various types of industries of economic importance. These include manufacturing, construction, agriculture, forestry and fishing, and to a lesser extent, mining (Department of National Treasury, 2019; The Real Economy Bulletin, 2024).

Land cover data shows the primary pressures within the terrestrial realm of the Eastern Cape driving loss of habitat due to clearing of land for croplands (42.9 % of the province plantations (6.8%), built-up areas (22.2%) and mining (\<1%) (Figure 3). Rates of habitat loss are generally higher in the eastern parts of the province driven by expanding human settlements, agriculture and plantations (Figure 4). Mining does not have a major foootprint within the province (\<1%).

![Figure 3. The percentage cover of land cover pressures driving habitat loss in the Eastern Cape province, based on the 2022 land cover data. The values alongside the bars indicate the percentage cover of each land-cover class. Croplands account for the largest share of habitat loss (42.9%), followed by secondary-natural vegetation (28%), built-up areas (22.2%), plantations (6.8%), and mining, which contributes the smallest share at less than 1%.](imgs/ec_prov_lcc_extent.png){fig-align="center"}

![Figure 4. Rate of recent habitat loss indicator (1990–2022) fo r the Eastern Cape, calculated per terrestrial ec osystem type. Notable habitat loss is observed in the northeastern regions of the province and along the western coastline.](imgs/ec_prov_habitatloss.png){fig-align="center"}

Major economic activities in the Eastern Cape province are manufacturing, construction, agriculture, forestry and fishing, and to a lesser extent, mining (Department of National Treasury, 2019; The Real Economy Bulletin, 2024). Recent habitat loss (1990–2022) within the province is most apparent in its northeastern parts and is particularly high within the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro, where rapid urban expansion has driven significant habitat loss. Several ecosystem types within the province (Buffels Valley Thicket, Motherwell Karroid Thicket, and Umtiza Forest Thicket) are listed as Critically Endangered in the 2022 National Red List of Ecosystems (Monyeki and Skowno, 2022) due to their restricted distribution and ongoing habitat loss. As shown in Figure 4 above, habitat loss driven by both natural and anthropogenic pressures not only reduces the extent of these ecosystems but can also escalate their threat status.

The northern parts of the Eastern Cape province have Grasslands as mentioned earlier. Grasslands are also extensively used for grazing by livestock and game but increasing agricultural expansion and intensification have intensified habitat fragmentation ( @slooten2023). Rutherford et al. (2012) showed that the loss of natural habitat within sites in the Sarah Baartman District Municipality (Figure 4) is likely due to heavy long-term herbivory resulted in a loss of natural vegetation which got replaced largely by alien, unpalatable species. Other land use and land cover studies also show that urban expansion and agricultural expansion particularly in the grassier areas within the province ( @zahn2017; Slooten et al. 2023). The most habitat loss within the province is a result of a high concentration of economic activities such citrus and goat farming which is popular in the portion of the province that has thicket vegetation and generally low in elevation ( @lechmere-oertel004; Department of National Treasury, 2019; The Real Economy Bulletin, 2024).

### Free State

The Free State province consists of four district municipalities: Fezile Dabi, Lejweleputswa, Mangaung, Thabo Mofutsanyane and Xhariep. Grasslands dominate across the province, with some occurrences of Azonal Vegetation whose distribution is driven by water and moisture availability, mainly along rivers, streams, drainage lines and areaswith high soil moisture content. Fragments of the Savanna and Nama-Karoo biomes are found in the western and southwestern parts of the province, respectively. The Free State province supports various industries of economic importance. These include mining, agriculture and manufacturing (Department of National Treasury, 2019; The Real Economy Bulletin, 2024).

![Figure 5. The proportional percentage of habitat loss drivers within the Free State province from the 2022 land cover data. Croplands contribute the highest percentage to habitat loss (78.7%), followed by secondary-natural (16.2%), built-up areas (2.9%), plantations (2%) and mining with the lowest percentage (0.3%).](imgs/fs_prov_lcc_extent.png){fig-align="center"}

![Figure 6. Rate of recent habitat loss indicator for the Free State, 1990–2022, calculated per terrestrial ecosystem type. Note the high rate of habitat loss in the northern portions of the province.](imgs/fs_prov_habitatloss.png){fig-align="center"}

Major economic activities in the province are mining and agriculture (Department of National Treasury, 2019; The Real Economy Bulletin, 2024). These economic activities coincide with the land cover data for the province (Figure 5). Habitat loss in the Free State province is most pronounced in the central to northwestern regions. The Vaal-Vet Sandy Grassland (Figure 6), which spans the boundary between the Free State and North-West provinces, and in both the Fezile Dabi and Lejweleputswa Districts. Another ecosystem type with a high rate of habitat loss in the province is the Eastern Free State Clay Grassland which extends across the eastern region of the province and is within the Thabo Mofutsanyane district (Figure 6). These ecosystem types occupy (xyz % of of the province, xx km2 and xx km2 respectively). They both stand out as the most impacted by land use within the province due to their high rates of recent habitat loss. Land cover shows that croplands, plantations and build-up areas (Figure 5) are the biggest drivers of habitat loss within the province. These land cover statistics are in consistent with economic data showing the agriculture, forestry, mining and urban expansion are the main activities with the province (Department of National Treasury, 2019; The Real Economy Bulletin, 2024).

Grasslands are also extensively used for grazing by livestock and game but increasing agricultural expansion and intensification have intensified habitat fragmentation (@brand2009; @slooten2023), and these are dominant pressures within the Grasslands, particularly in the Free State province.
his also supported by the increase in the agriculture sector of the province increasing contribution towards the province's GDP between 2010 and 2024 (The Real Economy Bulletin, 2024). In addition, land cover data (Figure 5) indicate that built-up areas are also playing a substantial role in the continued loss of natural habitat. Although mining has a small footprint within the province, the impacts on biodiversity are long lasting.

### Gauteng

The Gauteng province is characterised by a mosaic and transition zones between the Grassland and Savanna biomes. Savannas mainly found in the northern part of the province, with smaller fragments in the southwestern and southeastern areas. In contrast, the Grassland dominates the central and much of the remaining parts of the province. As a result, Gauteng supports a variety of economically important industries. Including manufacturing, construction, mining and agriculture (The Real Economy Bulletin, 2024). Gauteng has four district municipalities; City of Johannesburg, City of Tshwane, Ekurhuleni, Sedibeng and West Rand. Infrastructure and croplands are the biggest drivers of habitat loss within the Gauteng province (both more than 20% of the province’s extent).

![Figure 7. The percentage of habitat loss drivers within the Gauteng province from the 2022 land cover data. Built-up contribute the highest percentage to habitat loss (37.8%), followed by cropland (34.6%), secondary-natural (21.7%), plantations (4.3%) and mining with the lowest percentage (1.6%).](imgs/g_prov_lcc_extent.png){fig-align="center"}

![Figure 8. Rate of recent habitat loss indicator for Gauteng, 1990–2022, calculated per terrestrial ecosystem type. Note the remarkably high rates of habitat loss in metropolitan areas, the rate of loss calculated between 1990 and 2022.](imgs/g_prov_habitatloss.png){fig-align="center"}

Rates of habitat loss are remarkably high throughout the province but are highest in the metropolitan areas (City of Johannesburg and Tshwane). Ecosystems such as the Egoli Granite Grassland are listed as critically endangered (Monyeki and Skowno 2022), due to due on-going decline in natural habitat driven primarily by urban and road development , similarly, the Marikana Thornveld experiences the same pressure in Gauteng region (40% with the Gauteng province).Other ecosystem types like the Tsakane Clay Grassland (77% of the province) are under pressure due to croplands. 

Nhamo et al (2021) @nhamo2021 explain that habitat loss in Gauteng Province is predominantly driven by rapid urbanisation, which has led to substantial expansion of the built-up area. They report that between 1986 and 2019, built-up areas increased by over 170%, transforming significant portions of both Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBAs) and Ecological Support Areas (ESAs). Agricultural expansion contributed to 40.9% of this habitat loss, while urban development accounted for an additional 15.1%. The most affected areas include urban peripheries where informal settlements and cleared land have rapidly replaced vegetated and water-rich zones, particularly around Johannesburg, Tshwane, and Ekurhuleni. These trends explained by @nhamo2021 highlight the observed trends in Figure 7 captured by the land cover data. Mining does not have the lowest footprint in the province (Figure 7); however, it has contributed to habitat loss, water and air pollution due to acid mine drainage, particularly in the Witwatersrand area in Johannesburg ( @minnaar2020). Water pollution due to acid mine drainage is particularly a problem as it.\
\
Acid mine drainage is another major challenge within the province due to the mining industry, particularly in the Witwatersrand area in Johannesburg (Minaar, 2020). Although mining does not have a major footprint within the province (Figure 7), it's impacts extent beyond the area where mining occurs (Minaar, 2020).

### KwaZulu-Natal

The KwaZulu-Natal province contains a diverse mix of Savanna, Grassland, Forests, and Indian Ocean Coastal Belt biomes, along with smaller areas of Wetland vegetation. The Savanna biome dominates the low-lying northern and northwestern regions of the province. Grasslands are widespread across the central interior and southern uplands, particularly in the Midlands. Forests occur in fragmented patches along the escarpment, southern Drakensberg, and coastal scarp areas. The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt extends along the eastern coastline, supporting a mosaic of subtropical forest, woodland, and dune vegetation. Consequently, KwaZulu-Natal supports a range of economically important industries, including sugarcane production, commercial agriculture, forestry, and coastal tourism. KwaZulu-Natal has xx district municipalities; Amajuba, Harry Gwala, King Cetshwayo, Ugu, uMgungundlovu, uMkhanyakude, uMzinyathi, uThukela, Zululand, eThekwini and iLembe.

The KwaZulu-Natal province faces a suite of pressures which are the biggest drivers of habitat loss within the province. The primary pressures leading to this loss in KZN are croplands (nearly 12.5% of province), infrastructure (nearly 10% of the province) and plantations (nearly 8%) of the province. Although present, mining does not particularly have the greatest impacts within the province (\<1%).

![Figure 9. The key forms of habitat loss in KwaZulu-Natal are infrastructure and various field crops. The proportional percentage of habitat loss drivers within the KwaZulu-Natal province from the 2022 land cover data. Croplands contribute the highest percentage to habitat loss (over 29.7%), followed by secondary-natural (29.1%), built-up (22.4%), plantations (18.6%) and mining with the lowest percentage ( 0.2%).](imgs/kzn_prov_lcc_extent.png){fig-align="center"}

![Figure 10. Rate of recent habitat loss indicator for KwaZulu-Natal, 1990–2022, calculated per terrestrial ecosystem type. Note the remarkably high rates of habitat loss in metropolitan areas, the rate of loss calculated between 1990 and 2022.](imgs/kzn_prov_habitatloss.png){fig-align="center"}

Habitat loss rates are particularly high in the coastal (eastern) regions of KwaZulu-Natal, where sustained transformation is driven by a combination of expanding human settlements, industrial and residential infrastructure, commercial agriculture, timber plantations, and coastal tourism, ( @kznedtea2024) (Figure 10). Although coastal ecosystems remain the most heavily impacted, some northern interior areas also show exceptionally high rates of habitat loss, indicating that transformation pressures are widespread across the province. Previous land cover change analyses reported that 48% of the South Coast was already classified as developed by 2008 (Palmer and van Elst, 2023). This transformation was attributed to roadside strip of development, industrial expansion, and the construction of road infrastructure supporting residential growth (Palmer and van der Elst, 2013). Similarly, a province-wide assessment found that by 2011, 46.4% of KwaZulu-Natal’s natural habitat had been converted for various land uses including. agriculture, the built environment, plantations, mining, and dam development, transforming 46% of the natural habitat of the province (Jewitt et al., 2015). These patterns reflect the land cover data as in Figure 9 and align closely with the key drivers of land-cover transformation identified in earlier @palmer2012.

South Africa’s timberplantations are located either within or next to indigenous forest (@karumbidza2006). Land cover data from 2022 (Figure 9) indicates that plantations cover 18.6% of the province. Some industrial timber plantations (ITP) within KZN are in the coastal zone including Richards Bay and St. Lucia where there is high density of these ITPs ( @karumbidza2006).  Plantations led to habitat loss due to conversion of natural land to a single crop in each area which has associated impacts in reduced streamflow and impacting on indigenous aquatic species.

### Limpopo

Limpopo province is predominantly covered by the Savanna biome, with smaller areas of Grassland and Forest biomes. Savanna vegetation spans most of the province, from the Bushveld in the central and western areas to the Lowveld in the northeast. Grassland is limited to high-altitude areas in the south, particularly along the escarpment. Forests are restricted to small, moist patches on mountain slopes and ravines. As a result, there are various key economic activities in the province which include mining, agriculture, construction and manufacturing. Limpopo has xx district municipalities; Capricorn, Mopane, Sekhukhune, Vhembe and Waterberg.

The Limpopo province faces a suite of pressures which are the biggest drivers of habitat loss within the province. The primary pressures leading to this loss in Limpopo are croplands (over 10% of province), infrastructure (nearly 4% of the province). Plantations and mining do not particularly have the greatest impacts within the province (\<2%).

![Figure 11. The percentage of habitat loss drivers within the Limpopo province from the 2022 land cover data. Croplands contribute the highest percentage to habitat loss (43.2%), followed by secondary-natural (34.9%), built-up (17.7%), plantations (3.3%) and mining with the lowest percentage (less than 0.9%).](imgs/l_prov_lcc_extent.png){fig-align="center"}

![Figure 12. Rate of recent habitat loss indicator for Limpopo, 1990–2014, calculated per terrestrial ecosystem type. Note the high rate of habitat loss in the southern and central portions of the province.](imgs/l_prov_habitatloss.png){fig-align="center"}

Rates of habitat loss are generally higher in the southern and central parts of the province (the Sekhukhune District in particular) (Figure 12). The Sekhukhune Plains Bushveld ecosystem type is endangered according to the 2022 RLE (Monyeki and Skowno, 2022) due to on-going habitat loss which is primarily driven by croplands, urban development and mining. Another ecosystem type within the province that has experienced the highest habitat loss is the Woodbush Granite Grassland, primarily because of plantations which have been the key pressure to this ecosystem and have resulted in fragmentation of this ecosystem type ( @niemandt2016).

Although ecosystems like the Phalaborwa-Timbavati Mopaneveld in the Mopane region show lower rates of habitat loss than the Woodbush Granite Grassland, they are undergoing structural changes that affect ecosystem function due to intense land use, particularly communal livestock grazing (Rutherford et al., 2012). In the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve, a study by @musetsho2021 found that between 1990 and 2018, dense bush and subsistence agriculture declined, while woodland and built-up areas expanded. This shift, driven by deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urban encroachment, reflects broader Savanna biome trends, where croplands and infrastructure dominate habitat loss. Habitat loss in the area averaged 0.13% per year, highlighting ongoing development pressures and persistent threats to biodiversity.

### Mpumalanga

Mpumalanga province is characterised by a mix of Grassland, Savanna, and Forest biomes. The Grassland biome dominates the central and southwestern high-lying areas of the province, particularly across the Highveld plateau. The Savanna biome occupies the lower regions in the north and east, including the Lowveld and areas near the Kruger National Park. Forests occur in small patches along the escarpment and in moist mountain ravines. The province's diverse ecological zones support a range of economically important industries. Mpumalanga has three district municipalities; Ehlezeni, Gert Sibande and Nkangala. Economically important industries in the province include mining and manufacturing

Habitat loss in Mpumalanga as a result of land clearing for croplands (40.3% of the province)) which is the primary pressure in the provice. Infrastructure in the form of built-up areas (1.25%) and plantations (1% of the province) and mining (\<1%). Although having the lowest cover responsbilble within the province, Mpumalanga has a significant mining economy, with documented impacts on biodiversity, particularly on wetlands ( @curtis2024; Heyes, 2016).

![Figure 13. The key forms of habitat loss in Mpumalanga are various field crops and plantation forestry. From the 2022 land cover data, croplands occupy 40.3% of the Mpumalanga province, followed by secondary-natural (26.8), plantations (23.4%), built-up areas (7.8%) and mining (1.7%).](imgs/mp_prov_lcc_extent.png){fig-align="center"}

![Figure 14. Rate of recent habitat loss indicator for Mpumalanga, 1990–2022, calculated per terrestrial ecosystem type. Note the high rate of habitat loss in the southern and central portions of the province.](imgs/mp_prov_habitatloss.png){fig-align="center"}

Rates of habitat loss are generally higher in the southern and central parts of the province (Figure 14).  Endangered ecosystem types such as the Legogote Sour Bushveld (Monyeki and Skowno, 2022) have broad range of pressures, but plantations have been the key pressure. Built up areas cover have also been impacting the biodiversity in the province negatively due to expansion of infrastructure and settlements. Although mining covers less than 1% of the provincial extent, it has long-term direct and indirect impacts on species and ecosystems. @laisani2019 study on the Klipspruit mine in Witbank highlighted direct impacts such as contamination on rivers, causing a decline in aquatic biodiversity in the Olifants and Wilge rivers. In addition to polluting aquatic ecosystems, mining has resulted in extensive land degradation, loss of fertile soils, and declining agricultural productivity particularly in maize-producing areas. Air quality conditions are poor in the province due to exceedingly high levels of air pollution ( @groundwork2023).

### Northern Cape

The Northern Cape is a mosaic of the Nama-Karoo, Succulent Karoo, and Savanna biomes. The Nama-Karoo is the most extensive, covering the central, southeastern, and southern parts of the province. The northern and northeastern regions are occupied by the Savanna biome, while the southwestern and western parts are dominated by the Succulent Karoo.\
As a result, various economically important activities are supported by the province. The Northern Cape has xx district municipalities; Frances Baard, John Taolo Gaetswe, Namakwa, Pixley ka Seme and ZF Mgcawu. Economically important industries in the province include mining, agriculture, manufacturing and construction.

Habitat loss rates in the Northern Cape are significantly lower than the national average, with less than 4% of the province affected by anthropogenic activities. However, extensive mining along the coast and cropland expansion in the Fynbos/ Succulent Karoo transition areas of the far south have had notable local impacts.

![Figure 15. The key forms of habitat loss in the Northern Cape are various field crops and horticultural crops, human settlements and mining. Although minimal compared to the rest of the country (all below 1%). The secondary-natural occupies 40% of the province, followed by croplands (34.6%), built-up areas (14.1%), mining (10.9%) and plantations (0.3%).](imgs/nc_prov_lcc_extent.png){fig-align="center"}

![Figure 16. Rate of recent habitat loss indicator 1990–2022 calculated per terrestrial ecosystem type. Note the overall low levels of habitat loss in the arid Northern Cape.](imgs/nc_prov_habitatloss.png){fig-align="center"}

Habitat loss within this province comes as a result of land clearing for croplands (in the far south western parts of the province) (\<1%) and mining (\<.05%) (on the coast and in the Francis Baard District) (Figure 16 ) show that overall the province has low levels of habitat loss when compared to the rest of the country.

The areas examined in the studies by @jonas2004 and @haarmeyer2010 are located within several municipalities in the Namakwa District of the Northern Cape, including Kamiesberg, Hantam, and the Knersvlakte region. These municipalities encompass Namaqualand and the Knersvlakte, where extensive grazing dominates land use, affecting approximately 90% of the landscape. Grazing has been identified as the primary pressure driving vegetation change, with heavy grazing notably reducing plant diversity and threatening endemic species, particularly in the Knersvlakte. Cropland expansion (3.3%) and mining activities (1.7%) also contribute to land use pressures, especially in Hantam, Karoo Hoogland, Nama Khoi, and Khai-Ma municipalities, aligning with recent land cover data that show increases in secondary-natural areas and patterns of habitat loss. The Okiep District was mined at multiple localities for copper for decades since the mid-1800s. According to @rozendaal2013, mining productivity began to decline rapidly from the mid-1990s and eventually ceased in 2007. This decline is mirrored in the land cover data, which shows a notable reduction in mining extent over time. Since the closure of the mines, the area has been under rehabilitation @rozendaal2013 ). \
Mining and human settlements in Postmasburg ( @marais2018) expanded rapidly after 2010 when mining companies relocated worked to the town in 2011 with over 2 500 informal dwellings contributing to the growing area of built-up area captured by the landcover.

Provincial habitat loss rates remain generally low compared to national averages, with cropland conversion accounting for less than 1% of habitat loss in southwestern regions and mining less than 0.05% in coastal and Francis Baard District areas. However, more intensive pressures are evident in the Namakwa District municipalities studied, where extensive grazing continues to be the dominant driver of vegetation and biodiversity changes. The combined long-term impacts of grazing, agricultural expansion, and mining contribute to shifts in vegetation structure and species diversity across the region, highlighting the need for targeted management to conserve endemic flora and maintain ecological integrity.

### North West

The North West province contains a mix and transition of Savanna and Grassland biomes. The Savanna biome is dominant, occupying the northern, northeastern, western, northwestern, and southwestern parts of the province. The remaining central, southern, and southeastern areas are dominated by the Grassland biome. Consequently, the province supports a variety of economically important industries including mining, agriculture. The North West province has five district municipalities; Bojanala, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati, Gert Sibande and Ngaka Modiri Molema.

The primary pressure in the terrestrial realm in the North West province is habitat loss because of land clearing for croplands (nearly 30% of the province), infrastructure captured as built-up areas (2.5%) and mining (\<2%).

![Figure 17. The key forms of habitat loss in North West are various field crops including grains. Accroding to the 2022 land cover data, croplands occupy 63.7% of the North West province, followed by secondary-natural (26.5%), built-up areas (7.7%), plantation (1.3%) and mining (0.8%).](imgs/nw_prov_lcc_extent.png){fig-align="center"}

![Figure 18. Rate of recent habitat loss indicator for North West, 1990–2022, calculated per terrestrial ecosystem type. Note the high rate of habitat loss in the eastern and central portions of the province.](imgs/nw_prov_habitatloss.png){fig-align="center"}

Rates of habitat loss are generally higher in the eastern and central parts of the province. The Vaal-Vet Sandy Grassland (an ecosystem also occurring in the Free State province, is an endangered ecosystem type due to historical decline, and experiencing the most recent loss of habitat within province driven primarily by agriculture and further degraded by overgrazing, similar to the Free State. Another ecosystem type with the province with the highest habitat loss is the Rand Highveld Grassland (shared with the Gauteng province) is experiencing on going habitat loss due to agricultural activity within the North West province.

### Western Cape

The Western Cape province contains a mix of Fynbos, Succulent Karoo, Forests, and small patches of Albany Thicket and Grassland biomes. The Fynbos biome is dominant, covering most of the southern and mountainous regions, including the Cape Fold Belt and coastal areas. The Succulent Karoo occupies the arid northwestern interior of the province. Forests are restricted to small patches along the southern coast and mountain ravines. Albany Thicket and Grassland biomes occur in limited areas along the southeastern boundary of the province. Consequently, the Western Cape supports a range of economically important industries. The Western Cape has six district municipalities; Cape Winelands, Central Karoo, City of Cape Town, Garden Route, Overberg and West Coast.

The pressure resulting in habitat loss with the province are croplands and other forms of intensive agriculture (nearly 15% of the province), plantation forestry (2%), infrastructure and settlements (3%) and mining (\<1%).

![Figure 19. The key forms of habitat loss in the Western Cape are various field crops and horticultural crops, human settlements and plantation forestry. According to the 2022 land cover data, croplands occupy 67.9% of the Western Cape province, followed by secondary-natural (22.5%), built-up areas (6.2%), plantations (3.1%) and mining (0.3%).](imgs/wc_prov_lcc_extent.png){fig-align="center"}

![Figure 20. Rate of recent habitat loss indicator for the Western Cape, 1990–2022, calculated per terrestrial ecosystem type. Note the high rate of habitat loss in the Overberg and Swartland regions of the Cape lowlands.](imgs/wc_prov_lcc_habitatloss.png){fig-align="center"}

Habitat loss rates are generally higher in the lowlands of the Fynbos biome and coastal areas, driven by expanding human settlements and agriculture (Figure 20). In contrast, the arid interior and mountainous regions of the province experience lower rates of habitat loss. Ecosystem types such as Swartland Alluvium Fynbos are categorized as Endangered when ground-truthed and cross-referenced with land cover data, primarily due to ongoing agricultural expansion, particularly vineyards and orchards. Similarly, the Critically Endangered Swartland Shale Renosterveld has been largely converted to agricultural land and further impacted by urban development (Cape Nature, 2022; Monyeki and Skowno, 2022). The Lourensford Alluvium Fynbos is also undergoing rapid habitat loss, driven primarily by urban expansion and increasing built-up areas. The Cape Lowlands are dominated by urban development, whereas the renosterveld is dominated by agricultural landscapes. As reflected below.

In the Western Cape, the primary pressures on natural vegetation are concentrated particularly in lowland fynbos and renosterveld areas. Renosterveld, which occurs on fertile soils, has been extensively transformed for agriculture. Studies by @ntshanga2021 and @kemper1999 highlight that this transformation has led to severe habitat fragmentation. While larger renosterveld fragments retain more consistent plant communities, smaller fragments exhibit altered composition, reflecting ecological degradation. These altered patches, though still vegetated, are best described as secondary natural vegetation, areas that maintain some natural structure and function but differ from primary vegetation in composition and ecological integrity.

In lowland fynbos on nutrient-poor soils and Strandveld, urban expansion, especially around Cape Town and coastal developments has been the main driver of habitat loss and fragmentation. Ntshanga et al. (2021) @ntshanga2021 found that urbanisation has left behind small, isolated remnants of natural vegetation, embedded within highly transformed human-dominated landscapes.

## Approach

This report summarizes trends in extent of land cover change for South African from 1990 to 2022, and the rate of habitat loss for each province between 1990 and 2022. The aim of this report is to track loss of natural habitat and the drivers behind the loss.

**Input data:**

1.  National Land Cover 7 class version (prepared by SANBI) for 1990, 2014, 2018, 2020 and 2022 (based on National Land Cover products served by the Department of Forestry Fisheries and the Environment), reclassified by South African National Biodiversity Institute from 72 classes to 7 classes.

The re-classified National Land Cover 7 classes are described as follows:

1 = Natural or near natural ecosystems

2 = Secondary-natural area (previously cropland or mine or built-up, now revegetated partially)

3 = Artificial-waterbody (dams and water treatment)

4 = Built-up (villages, urban, industrial, commercial and infrastructure)

5 = Cropland

6 = Mine

7 = Plantation (alien timber and pulp plantations)

**A detailed description of each land cover classification is below,** based on @skowno2021a and DFFE (2024):

Table 1. Descriptions of the land cover classes used in this report and whether the class is classified as natural or non-natural.

| Land cover class | Description | Natural/ Non-natural classification |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Natural | Areas still in a natural or near-natural state, including indigenous grasslands, shrublands, forests, woodlands, natural bare areas, and natural water bodies | Natural |
| Secondary-natural | Previously transformed land (e.g., abandoned croplands or mines) now undergoing passive recovery. Vegetation may be returning, but the land remains altered. | Non-natural |
| Artificial-waterbody | Man-made water features such as dams, canals, sewage ponds, and flooded mine pits, distinct from natural lakes or rivers. | Non-natural |
| Croplands | Land actively used for crop production, including field crops, orchards, vineyards, pivot and non-pivot irrigation, and intensive farming such as feedlots. | Non-natural |
| Built-up | Includes all settlements (formal, informal, villages), commercial, and industrial areas, with roads, buildings, and other infrastructure replacing natural cover. | Non-natural |
| Plantation | Areas planted with non-native tree species for timber production, including mature plantations and recently harvested stands. | Non-natural |

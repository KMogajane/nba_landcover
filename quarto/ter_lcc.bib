It looks at, in detail, historic changes in coastal development and land cover over time for two sites. The KZN coastal zone has and continues to undergo rapid development due to a number of causes, including population growth, social and economic development and climate induced factors. The results presented indicate that a very high proportion of the KZN coastal zone is already densely developed, with much of it unevenly distributed. It is argued that urgent management interventions are needed in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the coast, the ecosystem services that it delivers and to provide protection for the very developments built in the coastal zone. The new South African Integrated Coastal Management Act provides a framework within which this can be achieved.},

            Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are amongst the major drivers of biodiversity loss globally. Although habitat fragmentation poses additional threats to biodiversity beyond habitat loss alone, the IUCN’s Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) does not provide guidance on how to assess these threats. This study develops an approach for incorporating habitat fragmentation into the RLE threat assessment and investigates additional insights such an analysis could provide beyond the analysis of distribution trends. This is achieved by quantifying RLE criteria A and B (distribution reduction, restricted distribution and decline) and comparing outcomes with indices of habitat fragmentation (core area, Largest Patch Index, Patch Cohesion Index and Aggregation Index) in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Results revealed that much of the Cape Floristic Region is severely threatened by both landscape transformation and habitat fragmentation, but that treating the habitat fragmentation indices as additional RLE criteria did not alter the ecosystem threat assessment outcomes. Whilst this suggests that the existing RLE criteria implicitly account for habitat fragmentation, the relationship between fragmentation indices and RLE criteria were weak and highly variable in some cases, indicating that the RLE criteria alone do not sufficiently account for the threat of habitat fragmentation. Supplementing the RLE with habitat fragmentation measures highlights additional, unique information on threats to ecosystems. This simple approach has the potential to assist in setting conservation priorities and management goals, particularly in fragmented ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Much of the Eastern Cape province in South Africa has been experiencing a severe drought since 2015. This drought has had major socio-economic effects particularly on the large impoverished rural population as well as on some urban areas where supplied water services have broken down in several cases. The region is influenced by both midlatitude and tropical systems leading to a complex regional meteorology that hitherto has not been much studied compared to other parts of South Africa. Here, the ongoing drought is examined in the context of long-term trends and the interannual rainfall variability of the region. Although the region has experienced drought in all seasons since 2015, focus here is placed on the spring (September–November) which shows the most consistent and robust signal. On average, this season contributes between about 25–35\% of the annual rainfall total. Based on CHIRPS data, it is found that this season shows a significant decreasing trend in both rainfall totals as well as the number of rainfall days (but not heavy rainfall days) for spring over most of the province since 1981. On interannual time scales, the results indicate that dry (wet) springs over the Eastern Cape are associated with a cyclonic (anticyclonic) anomaly southeast of South Africa as part of a shift in the zonal wavenumber 3 pattern in the midlatitudes. Over the landmass, a stronger (weaker) Botswana High is also apparent with increased (decreased) subsidence over and near the Eastern Cape which is less (more) favourable for cloud band development and hence reduced (enhanced) rainfall during dry (wet) springs. Analysis of mid-century (2040–2060) CMIP5 rainfall projections suggests that there may be a flattening of the annual cycle over the Eastern Cape with the winter becoming wetter and the summer drier. For the spring season of interest here, the multi-model projections also indicate drying but less pronounced than that projected for the summer.},

	abstract = {Increasing demand for food and environmental stressors are some of the most challenging problems that human societies face today and these have encouraged new studies to examine drought impacts on food production. Seeking to discuss these important issues in the South African context, this study analysed the impacts of drought on food security in one of the country's largest commercial agricultural land (Free State Province). Earth observation and crop data were acquired from Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples (AppEEARS) and GrainSA databases, respectively for years 2011/2012 to 2020/2021 over Free State Province. Two crops namely, maize and sorghum were obtained from the database and analysed accordingly to quantify drought impacts on the two crops. The result reveals that the years 2015 and 2018 were affected by extreme drought events (30\%) and impacted the agricultural sector in the study area. Findings further revealed that maize production observed the lowest recorded in the year 2014 and 2015 with about 2236,00 and 1190,50 tons, respectively. More so, results further showed that sorghum production recorded the lowest production in years 2019, 2016 and 2015 with about 23, 600, 24, 640 and 24, 150 tons, in that order during the period of study. The results confirm the impacts of drought on maize and sorghum productions in the year 2015 and other years that recorded the lowest productions during drought years. This development might have impacted food security in the study area, and this outcome will enable decision-making bodies on food security to enhance improved strategy in vulnerable areas.},

	abstract = {This paper examines how the riparian vegetation of perennial and ephemeral rivers systems in the semi-arid, winter rainfall region of South Africa has changed over time. Using an environmental history approach we assess the extent of change in plant cover at 32 sites using repeat photographs that cover a time span of 36–113 years. The results indicate that in the majority of sites there has been a signiﬁcant increase in cover of riparian vegetation in both the channel beds and adjacent ﬂoodplain environments. The most important species to have increased in cover across the region is Acacia karroo. We interpret the ﬁndings in the context of historical changes in climate and land use practices. Damage to riparian vegetation caused by mega-herbivores probably ceased sometime during the early 19th century as did scouring events related to large ﬂoods that occurred at regular intervals from the 15th to early 20th centuries. Extensive cutting of riparian vegetation for charcoal and ﬁrewood has also declined over the last 150 years. Changes in the grazing history as well as increased abstraction and dam building along perennial rivers in the region also account for some of the changes observed in riparian vegetation during the second half of the 20th century. Predictions of climate change related to global warming anticipate increased drought events with the subsequent loss of species and habitats in the study area. The evidence presented here suggests that an awareness of the region’s historical ecology should be considered more carefully in the modelling and formulation of future climate change predictions as well as in the understanding of climate change impacts over time frames of decades and centuries.},

In Fynbos, Grassland and Savanna Biomes, riparian ecosystems were found to have relatively-high ecological resilience to invasion by alien plants, except in some situations of closed alien stands (75–100\% aerial cover). Where alien invasion is the primary disturbance at a site, and invasion intensity is low ({\textless}75\% cover, with some indigenous species present), the recovery of riparian vegetation structure and functioning is a realistic goal through alien clearance alone. Careful clearance of the aliens to avoid damage to indigenous species, while ensuring a high kill rate for resprouting alien species, is sufficient action to ensure ecosystem recovery. However, it is important that alien follow-up control is maintained at a sufficient frequency and that adaptive management is exercised to deal with unplanned events, such as fire or a high rainfall year, that may stimulate renewed alien recruitment. In closed alien stands, clearance may be sufficient to restore ecosystem structure and functioning in some situations, but not in others. To be realistic, restoration goals must take into account the planned future use of the riparian zone and the current ecological condition of the surrounding catchment area. Where ecological integrity of the catchment is low (highly transformed, fragmented), restoration of natural riparian vegetation structure or composition is untenable in most cases. A more realistic goal will be to restore basic ecosystem functions through providing a vegetation cover, comprising non-invasive (preferably indigenous) species, that is resilient to flood events and re-invasion by alien plants. The functions restored should include the buffering of the aquatic ecosystem through erosion control, and a return to more natural hydrological flows. In less-transformed catchments, restoring riparian ecosystem structure and composition is a realistic goal where closed alien stands are cleared by the “Fell \& Remove” treatment. Seed banks provide indigenous herb and shrub species, but where recruitment is poor, especially after fire, active restoration is beneficial in facilitating vegetation recovery and suppressing alien recruitment. However, the costs and benefits of active restoration need to be further investigated. Simple decision trees with accompanying information boxes and species lists are presented to assist managers. Because of the complexity of the decision process, it is recommended that specialists assist project managers in drawing up site-specific restoration plans that dovetail with alien-clearing plans.

	abstract = {This is the first study documenting the distribution and population biology of the Endangered Aloe lettyae, an endemic to the highly threatened Woodbush Granite Grassland (WGG) in Limpopo Province, South Africa. We documented 19 A. lettyae populations and calculated the total area of occupied habitat at 17.5 ha within its extent of occurrence of 123 km2. Most populations were clustered on the south western side of the WGG, with all known localities less than 40 km apart in this severely fragmented vegetation type. Population size varied from 10 to 6547 plants, with ∼10,800 individuals estimated in total. Plant size and life history stage demographics were determined in seven of the 19 currently known A. lettyae populations, including two large populations, as well as a high- and a low-lying population, and constituted a representative sample of the entire geographical range of the species. For plant size, four metrics (number of leaves, number of leaf layers, height and diameter of the leaf rosette) were recorded for each sampled A. lettyae plant, and the presence of an inflorescence indicated its reproductive status. By means of the classification tree technique CHAID (Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection), we determined that of the four plant size metrics, the ‘number of leaves’ predicts A. lettyae’s life history stages and fecundity most accurately, and revealed significant differences in the life history stage structure of the seven surveyed populations. Five populations occurring in relatively undisturbed WGG fragments, including the two large populations, comprised high proportions of adult individuals (77–89\%), while only few A. lettyae juveniles were found (3–14\%). By contrast, the relatively high percentage of juveniles (25–58\%) and low percentage of adults (32–63\%) observed in two small populations found in a degraded WGG fragment and in non-natural habitat respectively, appeared atypical. The percentage of subadults varied little across the surveyed populations (8–13\%). In slow-growing, long-lived species such as A. lettyae, the dominance of adult individuals with a high probability of survival may be considered as indicative of stable populations. This study provides baseline A. lettyae population data for long-term demographic monitoring which will aid management and conservation of the range restricted, Endangered A. lettyae.},

	abstract = {The South African Highveld is recognised as a region having significant negative ambient air quality impacts with its declaration as an Air Quality Priority Area in 2007. Such areas require the implementation of specific air quality intervention strategies to address the air quality situation. A greater understanding of the composition of the atmospheric aerosol loading and the contributing air pollution sources will assist with the formulation and implementation of these strategies. This study aims to assess the composition and sources of the aerosol loading in Embalenhle and Kinross located on the Highveld. Fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10) aerosol samples were collected during summer and winter, which were quantified using the gravimetric method. Wavelength-Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (WD-XRF) and Ion Chromatography (IC) analysis were used to determine the chemical composition of aerosols. Mean PM2.5 concentrations in Embalenhle and Kinross ranged from 16.3 to 34.1 µg/m3 during winter and 7.4 to 19.0 µg/m3 during summer. Mean PM10-2.5 concentrations ranged from 10.3 to 114 µg/m3 during winter and 5.9 to 11.2 µg/m3 during summer. Si, Al, S, Na (winter only), Ca (summer only), SO42- and NH4+ were the most abundant species in PM2.5 during both seasons. In PM10-2.5, Si, Al, Na (winter only), SO42- and F- were the most abundant species during both seasons. The elements S and Ca also had high abundances at Embalenhle and Kinross, respectively, during summer. Source apportionment was undertaken using Positive Matrix Factorisation, which identified five sources. Dust, secondary aerosols, domestic combustion, wood and biomass burning, and industry were determined to be the contributing sources. Any measures to mitigate particulate air pollution on the Highveld should consider these key sources.},

	abstract = {Industry is increasingly devising and implementing environmental management policies. In view of the potential costs and risks involved, it is vital that the effectiveness of these policies be monitored and managed. As part of Eskom's environmental research programme, extensive air quality monitoring has been undertaken on a regional basis since the late 1970s, in order to assist management in assessing environmental impacts and to facilitate appropriate control strategies. Due to the strategic location of the monitoring sites, trends in air pollution related to domestic and industrial expansion, emission control strategies and electrification programmes may be identified. This paper provides data from Eskom's monitoring network situated in the Gauteng, Free State and Mpumalanga regions of South Africa, presents trends, and identifies the sources where possible. Recorded concentrations for 19941 are compared with the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) guidelines. In general, concentrations fell well below the DEAT guideline values, the exception being fine particulate matter at the site Bedworth Park in the Vaal Triangle, where the daily mean guideline was exceeded on 10 occasions. Possible sources of the pollutants are discussed, based on measured wind directions and knowledge of atmospheric processes at various hours of the day and night.},

	abstract = {Arid regions globally have suffered ecological damage as European colonists have displaced virtually all nomadic cultures over the past 300 years, exploiting grazing, fauna and water unsustainably in creating permanent settlements. The Karoo is one such arid region that covers about one third of South Africa. In common with arid regions globally, this sparsely-populated shrubland was historically used mainly for ranching, but is now becoming increasingly important for renewable energy generation (wind and sun), for adventure tourism, and potentially for mining. Current and future land users in the Karoo face challenges posed by damage caused by past land use, particularly overgrazing and impoundments. Land users of the future will probably experience additional challenges caused by the combined impacts of damaging land use and climate change. This review synthesizes the bodies of literature on the archaeology, ecology, land use history, environmental change and development planning. In doing so, we address the effects of historical land use on biodiversity and ecosystem goods and services in the region. We also identify avenues for future research, including mitigation and restoration actions required to make continued human occupation of the Karoo sustainable. Insights on the sustainability of the Karoo region are relevant when considering the socio-ecological futures of arid regions elsewhere.},

	abstract = {1 Gradients of animal impact known as piospheres tend to develop around artificial watering points, particularly in arid zones. Such grazing gradients represent a potential opportunity for differentiating the long-term effects of livestock activity from other environmental patterns. In this study, the impact of watering point provision on the plant cover, species richness and community structure of Karoo shrublands, South Africa, was investigated in the context of the evolutionary history and current grazing management practices of the region. 2 The impacts of watering point provision were investigated by sampling plant cover and composition along transects placed at set distances, ranging from 10 m to 2200 m, from 11 watering points. 3 Karoo vegetation cover and structure are relatively resilient to livestock grazing. Karoo plant diversity, as measured by species richness, evenness and dominance, was not as resilient. Twice as many species decreased as increased near watering points. The majority of species that decreased were regarded as being highly palatable to livestock. Heavy grazing, leading to death or repeated reproductive failure, is the most likely mechanism leading to the decline of such species. 4 The highly disturbed area immediately adjacent to watering points was dominated by forbs and contained a large proportion of alien species. Adjacent to this was a zone dominated by widespread shrub species of medium to low palatability. Areas most distant from watering points contained a greater proportion of species known to be highly palatable to livestock. The ability of dominant Karoo shrubs to tolerate heavy grazing may have allowed rangeland managers to maintain stocking rates above that which can be tolerated by the majority of species but which are supported by a minority of grazing-tolerant species. 5 Synthesis and applications. Highly palatable species are more abundant in areas distant from water points. Larger paddocks therefore provide a refuge for sensitive species that might otherwise be lost from the rangeland as a whole. Species that tend to occur away from watering points represent potentially useful indicators of grazing pressure. The use of these species as indicators of rangeland condition among landowners should be promoted.},

Motivated by concerns about renewable energy sprawl, this study quantifies the current and future (2050) land requirements for electricity generation in South Africa and evaluates the likely impact on natural biomes. Currently, around 340 km2 has been transformed for electricity generation (mainly coal-powered) and an additional 1 400 km2 is used for spacing requirements. Direct land use is expected to increase to 755–1080 km2 by 2050, and spacing requirements will increase to 10 700–16 750 km2 (0.9–1.4\% of South Africa’s land area). South Africa has excellent potential for renewable energy generation, with 36\% and 57\% of the land area being suitable for solar and wind development, respectively. Assuming that future developments are built on the most suitable land in the Renewable Energy Development Zones, the Nama-Karoo Biome will be most affected. It is concluded that concerns about renewable energy sprawl should not limit South Africa’s renewable energy capacity expansion plans.},

	abstract = {The Western Cape Province is currently faced with population growth, declining household sizes, increasing household numbers, high levels of migration, urbanization and escalating development pressures. These factors have consequently triggered changes in land use and land cover (LULC) and incited issues such as urban sprawl, marginalization of the poor, limited public access to resources, land degradation and climate change. This paper seeks to understand the most significant drivers of LULC change in the Western Cape Province. Focus is given to the major LULC changes which have occurred in the Province in past 24 years by integrating a desktop study of LULC changes using the 1990 and 2013-2014 South African National LULC datasets; document analysis; and expert opinion in the form of semi-structured interviews with municipal town planners. An adapted Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) Framework is used to analyse and understand LULC changes in the study area. LULC changes are driven by political, economic, technological, demographic, biophysical and cultural factors that must be considered in strategies and policies in future planning to avoid detrimental impacts on the environment whilst maintaining socio-economic benefits.},

	abstract = {Gold mining has played a vital role in the growth of South Africa's economy and the creation of major industrial and business centres such as Johannesburg. In recent years gold production has contracted, leading to widespread redundancies among mineworkers. The situation is particularly serious in the Free State goldfields, which are centred upon Matjhabeng municipality and the city of Welkom. The downsizing and closure of many gold mines has had serious economic and social effects on businesses, communities and individuals. This article examines the crisis faced by Matjhabeng and the Free State goldfields, and evaluates local economic development initiatives that have been introduced to provide employment and diversify the local economy. However, the magnitude of the crisis and the limited success of development initiatives suggest that much more significant and better coordinated interventions will be needed from a range of community-based and business institutions, together with support from provincial and national governments. The experiences of the Free State have wider relevance for other areas in which economic restructuring and job creation are key priorities.},

	abstract = {Cropland abandonment has been happening in different parts of the world and is being driven by socio-economic, ecological, edaphic, and environmental factors. Most of the research focusing on drivers of cropland abandonment, succession trajectories, and responses to active restoration initiatives has been conducted in the republic of Nepal and regions such as Europe and America. In South Africa, the impact of cropland abandonment on household livelihoods, changes in vegetation and soil properties, and soil seed bank statuses have been conducted mainly in the Eastern Cape Province. The drivers of cropland abandonment in South Africa are like those observed in other countries, except for a few, which are country-specific such as poor support of communal farmers compared to their counterparts in the highly mechanised commercial farming sector. There is also a shift from low input cropping in the distant fields to high input cultivation in homestead gardens. Research results elsewhere suggest a woody growth suppressive effect of grazing, particularly average grazing intensities, being crucial in suppressing woody proliferation while high grazing intensities are detrimental to herbaceous species’ richness and promote woody species’ encroachment. A combination of fire and grazing alters the natural succession trajectory by promoting fire-tolerant species and arresting woody species. Similar to other countries, cropland abandonment is associated with colonisation by alien invasive species which are favoured by cropping legacies, such as altered soil levels of pH, Nitrogen, and phosphorus. Furthermore, limited moisture in semi-arid areas promotes the encroachment of indigenous woody species. Secondary succession in abandoned croplands can be manipulated for the benefit of livestock production in communal areas by introducing management strategies that will discourage encroachment by both invasive and indigenous woody species which lowers the grazing capacity. Furthermore, active restorative practices, such as reseeding with indigenous mid succession perennial grasses and legumes, will improve forage quality in abandoned croplands. Our understanding of succession trajectories under various unique disturbance regimes experienced in South Africa, such as communal grazing of abandoned croplands, compared to situations in other parts of the world is limited. Furthermore, the influence of other factors such as fire, soil fertility, and moisture needs to be understood.},

Classification of each thicket type was determined using Maximum Likelihood Classification and patch analysis using Fragstats. Of the four major divisions of the Albany Thicket Biome, classification of the Mesic, Valley and Dune Thickets were successful. The classification indicated that almost half of these thicket types has been lost, transformed or degraded by agricultural or urban development. For Dune, Mesic and Valley Thicket, thicket fragment sizes ranged between 6 and 876 km2. Dune Thicket contained the smallest fragments (2 km2) of intact thicket, while Valley Thicket contained the largest fragments (251 km2) of intact thicket of the major divisions of the Albany Thicket Biome. The misclassification of Arid Thicket precluded an accurate determination of the level of degradation and a different approach to assess the degradation status will have to be devised for these open thicket areas that contribute 39\% of the original extent of the biome.},

Recent advances in remote sensing technologies paired with deep learning algorithms provide an unprecedented opportunity for monitoring changes in vegetation cover at spatial and temporal scales. Such data can feed directly into adaptive management practices and provide insights into restoration and regeneration dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation algorithms can accurately classify the canopy cover of Portulacaria afra Jacq. in imagery acquired using different models of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) and under variable light intensities. Portulacaria afra is the target species for the restoration of Albany Subtropical Thicket vegetation, endemic to South Africa, where canopy cover is challenging to measure due to the dense, tangled structure of this vegetation. The automated classification strategy presented here is widely transferable to restoration monitoring as its application does not require any knowledge of the CNN model or specialist training, and can be applied to imagery generated by a range of UAV models. This will reduce the sampling effort required to track restoration trajectories in space and time, contributing to more effective management of restoration sites, and promoting collaboration between scientists, practitioners and landowners.},

	abstract = {The origin and affinities of southern African subtropical thicket have been misunderstood and neglected. This formation was only recognised as a biome distinct from savanna and karoo in the mid 1990s. One hypothesis states that it is a young vegetation type, assembled from forest, savanna and karoo elements after Holocene climatic amelioration. Others have suggested an ancient history for thicket. Here we review fossil and phylogenetic data in order to provide a better assessment of the origins of thicket. Albeit patchy, the fossil data are suggestive of a Palaeogene origin for this formation. A review of molecular phylogenetic data of extant thicket lineages indicated three major patterns: (i) ancient Cretaceous elements, including Encephalartos and the Strelitziaceae, (ii) basally branching lineages - many of which dominate contemporary thicket - that evolved in the Eocene (e.g. in the Celastraceae, Sapindaceae, Didiereaceae, Crassulaceae: Cotyledonoideae), and (iii) lineages derived from adjacent biomes that diversified in thicket in association with Neogene climatic deterioration (e.g. Aizoaceae, Asteraceae). We provide a narrative account of the evolution of thicket, which concludes that it is an ancient formation, extending back at least to the Eocene and derived initially from elements in the forest formations that prevailed in Upper Cretaceous and early Palaeogene times. As a biome, thicket is not uniquely southern African, being part of a formation that was globally widespread in the Eocene and which is extant in many parts of the world. Future research on the origins of thicket should focus on providing dates for major dichotomies as a complement to the rapid emergence of molecular phylogenies, as well as data on the genetic variation in populations of taxa categorised as ancient or young, and widespread or range-restricted.},

	abstract = {Transformation of South African succulent thicket in response to grazing is widespread and characterized by the extensive replacement of dense closed-canopy thicket with a 'pseudo-savanna' of remnant trees with an ephemeral field layer. In this study, we examined the patterns of transformation in a semi-arid succulent thicket ecosystem using replicated fence line contrasts. We quantified the changes in plant species and functional diversity, physiognomy and biomass. We tested whether the remnant tree guild of the transformed thicket is in a stable state, using aerial photographs and ground-truthing to track the survivorship of canopy trees over 60 years in transformed landscapes. We investigated the impacts of transformation on recruitment into the canopy tree guild by measuring seedling establishment across the fence line contrasts. Transformation results in a significant loss of plant and functional diversity. There is a significant reduction in the biomass and structural complexity of the vegetation, both vertically and horizontally. The canopy tree guild in transformed thicket is not stable owing to ongoing adult mortality and little successful recruitment. These results are interpreted in a framework of ecosystem functioning and long-term stability. We suggest that the pseudo-savanna typical of transformed succulent thicket is not a stable alternative state to intact thicket, but rather an intermediate stage in a trajectory towards a highly desertified state where only the ephemeral grasses and forbs persist.

	abstract = {Ecosystem carbon storage in intact thicket in the Eastern Cape, South Africa exceeds 20 kg/m(2), which is an unusually large amount for a semiarid ecosystem. Heavy browsing by goats transforms the thicket into an open savanna and can result in carbon losses greater than 8.5 kg/m(2). Restoration of thicket using cuttings of the dominant succulent shrub Portulacaria afra could return biodiversity to the transformed landscape, earn carbon credits on international markets, reduce soil erosion, increase wildlife carrying capacity, improve water infiltration and retention, and provide employment to rural communities. Carbon storage in two thicket restoration sites was investigated to determine potential rates of carbon sequestration. At the farm Krompoort, near Kirkwood, 11 kg C/m(2) was sequestered over 27 years (average rate of 0.42 +/- 0.08 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). In the Andries Vosloo Kudu Nature Reserve, near Grahamstown, approximately 2.5 kg C/m(2) was sequestered over 20 years (0.12 +/- 0.03 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). Slower sequestration in the Kudu Reserve was ascribed to browsing by black rhinoceros and other herbivores, a shallower soil and greater stone volumes. Planting density and P. afra genotype appeared to affect sequestration at Krompoort. Closely-packed P. afra planting may create a positive feedback through increased infiltration of rainwater. The rate of sequestration at Krompoort is comparable to many temperate and tropical forests. Potential earnings through carbon credits are likely to rival forest-planting schemes, but costs are likely to be less due to the ease of planting cuttings, as opposed to propagating forest saplings.},

Severe degradation of thicket is of major concern in terms of threatened biodiversity, unsustainable utilization and collapse of other ecosystem services. We used a natural, field contrast, case-study approach, sampling within plots under lightly and heavily stocked conditions. Mean plant species diversity and richness did not change significantly at sample plot level although there was a 27 per cent decline in richness with degradation at the scale of the study site. On degraded plots, there was a high species turnover and high beta diversity, which created a replacement zone rather than an impoverished zone. Replacement species were confirmed as mainly, but not exclusively, weedy annual grasses and alien forbs. The few persisting perennials were small trees that survived above the browse line, and hardy shrub species. Perennial persisting and replacement species below the browse line may suggest potential candidates for restoration. Nitrogen was the only measured nutrient that showed a significant decrease with degradation. Phosphorous, potassium and magnesium increased significantly, with the first two mentioned reaching potentially excessive levels. Soil salinization occurred with an order of magnitude increase in sodium. Thus, the increased cation exchange capacity occurred together with development of a nutrient imbalance. The elevation in some nutrients and soluble salts is ascribed to wind-determined directional grazing that concentrate livestock in the degraded area. The implications of the above altered soil conditions for thicket restoration need to be further explored. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Reversing ecological degradation through restoration activities is a key societal challenge of the upcoming decade. However, lack of evidence on the effectiveness of restoration interventions leads to inconsistent, delayed, or poorly informed statements of success, hindering the wise allocation of resources, representing a missed opportunity to learn from previous experiences. This study contributes to a better understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of ecosystem services at ecological restoration sites. We developed a method using Landsat satellite images combined with a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design, and applied this to an arid rural landscape, the Baviaanskloof in South Africa. Since 1990, various restoration projects have been implemented to halt and reverse degradation. We applied the BACI approach at pixel-level comparing the conditions of each intervened pixel (impact) with 20 similar control pixels. By evaluating the conditions before and after the restoration intervention, we assessed the effectiveness of long-term restoration interventions distinguishing their impact from environmental temporal changes. The BACI approach was implemented with Landsat images that cover a 30-year period at a spatial resolution of 30 meter. We evaluated the impact of three interventions (revegetation, livestock exclusion, and the combination of both) on three ecosystem services; forage provision, erosion prevention, and presence of iconic vegetation. We also evaluated whether terrain characteristics could partially explain the variation in impact of interventions. The resulting maps showed spatial patterns of positive and negative effects of interventions on ecosystem services. Intervention effectiveness differed across vegetation conditions, terrain aspect, and soil parent material. Our method allows for spatially explicit quantification of the long-term restoration impact on ecosystem service supply, and for the detailed visualization of impact across an area. This pixel-level analysis is specifically suited for heterogeneous landscapes, where restoration impact not only varies between but also within restoration sites.},

	abstract = {Policies surrounding energy development are frequently implemented in response to known or perceived problems. South Africa is in a unique position to develop prospective policies that build on knowledge gained from elsewhere. This paper provides a prospective analysis of hydrogeological risk pathways and vulnerability attributes in advance of anticipated shale gas operations in the Karoo Basin of South Africa. The ‘hazard-pathways-receptors’ approach is applied to define the hydrogeologic system in the context of potential sources of water resource contamination. This case study focuses on two critical hydrogeological risk pathways: regional groundwater flow and discrete structural features. Depending on the targeted area (hydro-litho-structural domain, depth of target, presence of aquitard, intrusion ratio), the capacity of deep natural pathways to enable hydraulic fracturing fluids, chemicals, or produced water to reach shallow groundwater, will be reduced or difficult. Deep artesian water could however be intercepted at different depths and, based on past groundwater exploration in the Karoo, water could flow into horizontal fractures or openings characterising the shallow aquifers: sills-ring complexes, lithological contacts, and transgressive fractures across dolerite dykes. However, above-ground water and wastewater management safeguards are needed to protect shallow groundwater from potential water quality degradation due to a) flowback or produced water b) stray gas and/or c) spills or illicit discharges that could introduce contaminants into groundwater resources. This paper describes a systematic approach to evaluate hydrogeologic risk pathways and informs adaptive management policies to protect South African groundwater resources.},

	abstract = {Mining of metals such as gold, silver and copper results in the exposure to water and air of rock ore containing sulphides. This leads to the formation of several harmful products such as sulphuric acid. If uncontrolled, the water drainage from such mines may runoff into streams or rivers or leach into groundwater thus ultimately entering the underground water systems (water table) which are interlinked over vast areas. This water flows out of mines, termed Acid Mine Drainage (AMD), is dangerous for people’s health, as well as plants, animals and aquatic life. By the mid-2000s Acid Mine Drainage had reached a crisis point in the Gauteng Province of South Africa, the centre of the gold mining industry in that country. This crisis was simply because some mining companies had abandoned mines without rehabilitating them underground, nor neutralising the above ground mine dumps and slime dams, further resulting in acid mine water flowing into streams, dams and sources of groundwater all over the province. Despite government efforts to get mining companies to take responsibility to ‘clean up’ mine water seepage, mine dumps, and slime dams, outflows of acid mine water continue to pollute water systems throughout Gauteng. This chapter examines the tardy efforts of the central government to enforce the mine rehabilitation and acid mine water neutralisation regulations on mining houses, who themselves have for many years conveniently ignored them in pursuit of maximising profits.},

	abstract = {In 2007, the South African government commissioned a national-scale survey of invasive alien plants. The survey estimated the cover of 14 plant taxa on 47,830 plots of 100 × 100 m, using observers in low-flying aircraft. The survey was completed in 2008 and repeated between 2016 and 2023. An estimated 1.6\% of the country was invaded at the end of the second survey, an increase of 10.6\% between the two surveys. Trees in the genera Acacia, Eucalyptus, Pinus and Prosopis accounted for almost three quarters (72.4\%) of the cover at the end of the second survey. The cover of most taxa increased between the two surveys, but some Acacia species, as well as Hakea shrubs and cacti (family Cactaceae), all of which are under biological control, decreased in cover. While other species increased despite biological control, there were no decreases in species that did not have biological control. The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt was the most invaded terrestrial biome, with 11\% of the remaining natural vegetation invaded, followed by the Fynbos, Albany Thicket and Grassland biomes with 5.2, 2.8 and 2.5\% alien plant cover respectively. For the remaining biomes, cover of invasive taxa was 1.1\% or less. Wattles (Acacia dealbata, A. decurrens and A. mearnsii) and Eucalyptus species occupied the largest area and spread more rapidly than other taxa, but the relative contribution of taxa differed between biomes. Pinus and Prosopis trees were substantial threats in the Fynbos and arid area biomes respectively. Our results suggest that control efforts have not managed to stem the spread of invasive alien plants at a national scale, other than for some of those under biological control. This suggests that scarce funds should be focussed on priority areas, and that there should be a greater emphasis on expanding the use of biological control.},

	abstract = {Questions The degree to which renosterveld shrublands are fire-dependent is currently unclear. To address this issue, the following questions were asked: (1) does smoke stimulate germination of soil-stored seeds in renosterveld; (2) does recently-burned renosterveld display changed composition and higher diversity than unburned vegetation; and (3) how do the species compositions of renosterveld soil seed banks and standing vegetation compare? Location Swartland, Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. Methods Soil seed bank samples from a north- and south-facing slope were smoke-treated and germinated to test for smoke-stimulated germination. Burned standing vegetation was surveyed 16 months post-fire, as was unburned vegetation on the same slopes. Seed bank species richness and density were compared between smoke-treated and untreated samples within and between slopes. Burned and unburned standing vegetation were compared within and between slopes in terms of species richness, abundance and aerial cover. Compositional similarity of the seed banks and standing vegetation was assessed. Results Seed banks were dominated by annuals and graminoids. Smoke treatment had no effect, except for driving significantly higher species richness and seedling density in south-facing slope perennial shrubs. Species richness and seedling density were significantly higher in seed banks on the south-facing slope compared to the north-facing slope. Burned standing vegetation exhibited significantly higher diversity than unburned vegetation. Annuals and graminoids displayed significantly higher species richness and aerial cover in burned renosterveld. The north-facing slope contained less than half the number of species/m2 compared to the south-facing slope. The seed banks and standing vegetation showed low to intermediate similarity (Sørensen = 31\%–53\%), but grouped close together on an NMDS plot, suggesting intermediate similarity overall. Conclusions Elevated germination of perennial shrubs in smoke-treated seed bank samples and increased diversity of post-fire standing vegetation suggest the renosterveld in this study shows elements of a fire-driven system. Certain species only recruited in burned sites, suggesting fire-stimulated germination. Aspect had a major influence on plant community composition, with the mesic south-facing slope being more diverse than the xeric north-facing slope. The similarity between the seed banks and standing vegetation was higher than previously shown for renosterveld, and appears to be higher than for fynbos.},

Renosterveld is one of the most critically endangered habitats in the biologically unique Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. For the first time, we map and synthesize the current state of knowledge on renosterveld ecology and conservation. We investigated 132 studies for the themes, locations and taxa of renosterveld research and the fragmentation, threats, recommendations and barriers to renosterveld conservation. More studies focused on plants than any other taxa (48\% of articles) and are conducted mostly in larger, intact renosterveld fragments. The most commonly identified threat to renosterveld was agricultural intensification; conservation recommendations spanned improved farming practices, formal protection and local patch management. Conservation implementation has been piecemeal and has depended largely on the goodwill of landowners, which can be constrained by costs of conservation measures and a lack of suitable restoration means. Citizen science is a promising potential solution to some barriers. Fragmented knowledge in such a transformed and relatively densely populated region highlights the scale of knowledge gaps for other biodiversity hotspots and has implications for ongoing conservation work.},

Here, we report the severe and potentially irreversible degradation of vegetation, ecosystems, and biodiversity in the northernmost more than 1 million ha of the Succulent Karoo, a global biodiversity hotspot. In our study, we use monitoring data spanning 45 years to disentangle different processes of change which started decades ago. The regionally important, vulnerable ecosystem “Gariep silty plains” is inhabited by the species-rich vegetation alliance Brownanthion pseudoschlichtiani. The cushion-like dwarf shrub scorpionstail (Brownanthus pseudoschlichtianus, Aizoaceae) is the dominant plant species protecting the soil and facilitating silt sedimentation. Following disturbances, this vegetation type is thinning and losing perennial plant species. This allows aeolian erosion, which – as a tipping point - turns the silty topsoil into sandy soil across extensive areas. Increased mobilisation of aeolian sand causes abrasion and sedimentation, which buries vast landscapes. The newly developed sandy topsoils are invaded by species-poor grassland communities partly typical for the Namib Desert biome. We present a novel S\&T model and discuss cascading effects which threaten nature, farmland and infrastructure. Farming, mining, road construction and climate change may be interacting drivers of degradation.},
